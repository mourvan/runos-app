libraft is a C++ (C++14) implementation of the raft concensus algorithm.

The goal is to provide a minimal implementation of the raft concensus algorithm. Any part of raft that isn't core to how raft builds concensus will have a well documented abstract interface that you can implement to meet your specific needs. Sample implementations of the abstract interfaces will be provided. The abstract interfaces are the following:

Networking with implementations using libuv and asio.
Storage using a file and an std::vector (I implemented an sqlite3 storage backend put performance was abysmal)
Serialization with implementations using http-parser and std::istream/std::ostream.

TODO:
libuv based networking
http based serialization
make file fsync cross-platform

MATURITY PHASES:
phase 0: libraft supports a static set of nodes, and has 2 sample implementations per abstract interface
phase 1: libraft is properly documented and tested.
phase 2: libraft supports ad-hoc adding/removing nodes.

Currently libraft is at phase 0
