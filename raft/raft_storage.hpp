//raft storage is simple. You must keep a log of entries. Once committed, they are immutable.
//There will always be a certain amount of logs that have been appended and not comitted.
//When appending new logs, if a non-comitted log is already stored, the newly appended log
//takes precedence and deletes the previously uncommitted logs.
//i.e:
//
//index 1 entry 1. <-committed
//index 2 entry 2. <-committed
//index 3 entry 3. <-committed
//index 4 entry 4. <-appended
//index 5 entry 5. <-appended
//
//If append tries to append logs below index 4, there's a serious problem because the entries are comitted.
//If append adds an entry at index 6, just append it.
//If append adds an entry at index 4, then delete entries including and after 4 (4 and 5),
//and append the new entries
